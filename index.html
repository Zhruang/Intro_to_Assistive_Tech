            <p>This week’s objective is basically to finalize the design in Fusion. One big part that was yet to be
              included in the design last week was the installation of electronics (micro-controller & sensor) into the
              pedal. Given the benefits of using a digital distance sensor, the electronic parts could really be
              positioned anywhere as long as the sensor is able to read the distance between the pedal and the base. The
              solution I came up is shown in the illustration: electronics (an Arduino Nano 33 and a Sharp Digital
              Sensor) are positioned near the left edge of the pedal base so that the usb-c port could be easily exposed
              on the left side; a recess is created to half-house the electronics (I attempted to design the part in
              which the electronics could be almost fully enclosed but turned out to be unnecessarily complex); two
              adhesive rubber bumpers are placed each on one side of the base to provide some cushioning by the end of
              the pedal travel and also to create some breathing space in-between the two parts so that the electronics
              won’t come into contact with the upper pedal.</p>
            <p>At this point, my pedal switch design is basically settled. Given the limited resources around, I am not yet able to produce a fully-functional 3d-printed model but only to make a couple of 3d renders for reference. Most parts of the Fusion model are designed with practicality in mind so one potentially will be able to produce a functional physical model with the fusion file. </p>

            <p>Over the course of this week, I tried to actually put my thoughts together and started to make sketches
              along with some Fusion modeling as well. One major update on the overall design of the pedal switch that
              happened this week is the idea of making my pedal switch adjustable. For I am aiming for a more universal
              design, being able to put the switch into use under various circumstances and for various people would be
              a reasonable next step. So, both the angle (between the pedal and the base) and the force (coming from the
              tension of the spring) are designed to be adjustable in order to cater to different needs. Using the pedal
              while standing might require a smaller angle than using it while sitting in front of the desk, for
              instance; People don’t feel comfortable putting too much force into engaging with the switch may choose to
              use one with a lighter force. Such a feature is enabled by making the key mechanical component of the
              pedal—the spring—interchangeable. Each end of the spring is attached to a small cylinder base which itself
              is embedded with magnets. Round recesses into which the interchangeable springs could perfectly fit are
              created both on the base and the pedal, between the space where the spring would be in, and following the
              axis that runs from the front to the end of the pedal. The user will have freedom putting the
              interchangeable spring into different positions depending on the needs. The closer the spring is to the
              hinge, the more the pedal is opened up, and vice versa. I would also like to offer the option of having a
              set of springs that come with different forces to better fit the needs of different groups of people. On
              top of that, switching to a lighter spring while placing it closer to the hinge would provide the larger
              opening angle while maintaining a similar force feedback from the pedal, which is a nice implementation of
              both two customizable aspects.

            <P>With queries about potential physical forms of my pedal switch, I went through some materials floating
              around on the Internet, and from the websites that Tamara kindly offered to me. I found one particular
              design that meets some of the qualities of the switch that I envisioned and thus could be referenced as a
              good starting point. He cut off two pieces of acrylic sheets as the pedal and the pedal base. Hinges are
              used on one side to connect the two pieces, and a switch and a strong spring on the other side to complete
              the basic yet functioning form of his pedal switch. Yet I am going for that progressive, analog output
              from the switch rather than an on / off, one simple switch could not be enough for the purpose and thus
              need to be replaced by something that can afford more. Digital distance sensor / Proximity sensor came to
              mind for I realized that I could totally free the sensor from the constraint of the pedal travel and
              pressure mechanism. Instead of using a pressure sensor that would lead to an excessive complexity of its
              mechanism, using a distance sensor that simple reads the distance between the pedal and the pedal base
              seems to me as a better option for then there is no worrying about whether stepping on the pedal too
              heavily would break the sensor and etc. </P>
            <p>The potential use cases for my pedal switch will definitely be a focus over the next a few weeks. I
              haven’t yet found a ton of scenarios where such a switch would offer functionality that other on / off
              switch could not. However, what I do believe is that there still are great values in creating such a
              switch for there are few pedal switches, and adaptive switches in general, that could offer a continuous,
              progressive output currently on the market, and such a feature will definitely find places where it will
              fit the best. And, after all my pedal switch could just be used as a normal on / off switch as a last
              resort. Enough with excuses, now are a couple of use cases that I can think of at the moment: it could be
              used as a low-cost racing simulator pedal, or video game controller in general; it could be used to fine
              tune the color hue and brightness of some of the smart light bulbs on the market; could it be used to
              control the bathroom water faucet?; it could even be used as a musical instrument once you map the outputs
              signals onto a gamut of musical notes.</p>

            <p>For me, the experience of seeing footages of the life at Camp Jened was ... shocking. I did not get as
              much as shock from simultaneously seeing that many disabled people like one of the counselors at Camp
              Jened once felt as said in the film, than from seeing the overflowing happiness and passion coming from
              everyone at the Camp. As a person who has lived his entire life in the city and “on the grid”, I could get
              enough anxiety just thinking about camping at somewhere in the countryside and not having an Internet
              connection and not having 30-minute food deliveries. I have become too spoiled by the so-called “modern
              life” to picture myself finding pleasure in sleeping in sheds or tents, fear of crabs, or unexciting diet.
              This resistance coming from myself speaks about the difference in the times and confrontation between city
              and countryside. What has the technologically advanced, highly efficient and seemingly orderly modern
              society turned me into? A person who is unable to adapt, and enjoy life outside the comfort zone carefully
              tailored by a larger culture. What was flourishing at the Camp Jened was the emancipation of individuality
              and solidarity among a group of people with strong relationships that eventually stimulate a tough
              struggle against discrimination and inequality then spanned decades. The strong spirit coming from the
              Camp is incredible and worthy of massive respect.</p>

            <p>Britney Wilson in her essay “On NYC’s Paratransit, Fighting for Safety, Respect, and Human Dignity” has
              carefully pictured to us a staggering amount of issues around the running of Access-A-Ride in New York
              City—inconsiderate services from Access-A-Ride drivers, inefficient communication between passengers and
              drivers, unreasonable policies, and bad routings around the city, and so on. If someone stands aside and
              examines the New York City public services and city life in general, one may easy get to the conclusion
              that: yes, Access-A-Ride service is bad; but it’s not much different from any other aspects of the city
              life that at any minute could lead people into frustrations—expensive taxis, endless traffic jams,
              never-on-time subways, enraged pedestrians. If you follow this direction and think, well, Access-A-Ride
              itself has already been a practical social progress and a helpful service to fill the needs of tens of
              thousands of people in the city. </p>
            <p>The real problem, however, lies underneath. It is the society’s attitude towards people in need of this
              service, usually people that are disabled in one way or another. Then you see rude and offensive drivers
              complaining about the troubles disabled people have given to them, and the society, as depicted in
              Wilson’s story. As opposed to consider themselves as people who put real action into helping people in
              need (the idea itself could lead to problematics for many of the difficulties disabled people would bump
              into on a daily basis are fundamentally caused by the lack of consideration for and attention to disabled
              people), these drivers think their passengers as unashamed people who take advantage of and are wasting
              the public resources. </p>
            <p>Wilson has made a rule for herself that in most cases she would only file Access-A-Ride complaints that
              attack on the larger system and policies “unless an individual driver’s behavior represents a larger
              systemic problem”. However many of the annoying and disturbing drivers she met over the years, Wilson is
              rational and sane enough to pull herself out and try to foster improvements on a systematic level. Yet, in
              the second half of her essay, she tells the story of a driver peeing into a cup in front of her on the
              bus, with only two of them. It is annoying and disturbing? 200% percent. Does this behavior represents a
              larger systemic problem in Access-A-Ride? Not accurately. This behavior represents an even larger problem
              that has to do with the society’s attitude towards minorities and this attitude is manifested by the
              conduct of any individual. The peeing driver is an “enforcer” of many of the problematics of the
              society—not seeing disabled people as equal; peeing in front of a lady on a bus as if it was totally
              normal suggests that he might not even see her as human but a neutralized and dehumanized existence, which
              could be said as a common attitude towards disabled people. While we realize the ill attitudes and
              preconceptions stem from a larger degree of social education and discourse, the fact that many of the
              direct difficulties and threats are put onto disabled people by one and another individual is often
              overlooked among debates around the more remote and institutional aspects of this issue.</p>

            <p>One big takeaway from both the virtual field
              trip to ADA and the videos on Lynn Valley’s website is in fact surprisingly the promise of
              “Do-It-Yourself” which is coming back in fashion. As we feel feeble when looking at the jaw-dropping
              prices of adaptive devices commonly found on the market and facing designers’ monopolized
              taste-making, the concept of DIY can be a remedy to reclaim the control of personal life. Cardboard,
              the magic medium that ADA has long trusted and put into wide use, is without exaggeration the single
              best medium for DIY adaptive design. Hours before the second week’s class have I forgotten to
              prepare some cardboard for the class only to realize they are readily spotted lying at the corners
              of my home – packing boxes that come with deliveries on a daily basis. One may never be worried
              about running out of cardboard but to compliment on its rigidity and versatility. </p>
            <p>As a person’s need can be so infinitely specifc
              and idiosyncratic, the person herself/himself or close family members can turn out to be the most
              appropriate designer candidate. With mass production, project launch and bureaucracy out of the way,
              and with any material at hand (cardboard obviously as a nice choice), one can make designs that
              adapt to personal needs just fine. In that, to me the biggest contribution of ADA and Valley’s
              website is their educational values. The videos of simple yet sufficient designs introduced by Lynn
              Valley, workshops held in ADA, and the vitual field trip to ADA as it is, are precious inspirations
              that advocate for mutual help and self-help within our respective communities.</p>
            <p>The chapter “Feeling Meets Testing” in the book
              <em>Design Meets Disability</em> converses mainly around the concept of <em>experience
                prototyping.</em> A rather recently-recognized concept that centers around user experience in its
              development at the potential expense of other criteria within a larger project. Well responding to
              the aim of eliminating ambiguity in defining the term <em>prototype</em> and clarifying the roles of
              various types of prototypes in their respective fields, the essay suggests that in certain
              appropriate cases, the user experience and client’s direct (or almost direct) engagement in the
              ongoing project can be and should be foremost prioritized even if it requires faking certain
              mechanism or technology and making temporary compromises on other aspects of the design as long as
              the promise at the end could be realized.
            </p>
            <p>The emphasis on experience prototyping in modern
              design, particularly in adaptive design lies in the fact that user experience has become indeed the
              dominant factor in determining the value of a piece of design and ties with the design’s fundamental
              purpose. Feedbacks retrieved from experience prototypes could potentially avoid waste of huge
              financial investment and numerous person-hours, and guide designers toward some more promising
              direction as early as possible. </p>
            <p>Another important and compelling role of
              experience prototyping is to figure out “what is the question” aside from to figure out “what is the
              answer”. As illustrated in the second half of the chapter with a series of user cases, experience
              prototyping’s capability of stimulating introspections, or public discussions around social issues
              challenges against the idea of <em>design</em> being merely a tool for problem-solving and reveals
              its potential of pushing humanity forward.</p>
            <p>The chapter “Identity Meets Ability” in the same
              book questions the existence of a clear distinction between “disabled” and “able-bodied”, adaptive
              design and mainstream design, and faults the binary philosophy underneath such definitions. “Every
              human being can experience some degree of disability.” This idea put forward by WHO may well be a
              guideline for designing for a wider audience, or to say, <em>universal design. </em>The chapter
              elaborates this idea even further as something that would sound like “every human being can
              experience some degree of disability depending on the context they are situated in.” It is the
              society and life situations that define one’s disability and ability. So commonly and easily have we
              connect the word “disabled” with the idea of physical impairment but in fact “activity limitation”
              and “participation restriction” as two manifestations of disability, which, yes, “impairment” may
              well lead to, in a broader view, can be seen as “a universal human experience”. On an imaginary
              spectrum of disability, almost everyone can find a position in any of its multiple dimensions. Take
              “visual impaired” as a example – people who are physically blind, people who are shortsighted,
              people who are shortsighted and accidentally forget to wear glasses, people whose eyes are occupied,
              people who don’t feel like having their eyes occupied, and many many other, can at some point be
              “visually impaired” and demand for adaptive designs that cater to this difficulty. </p>
            <p>Disability may even extend beyond the realm of
              the human body. In this world that is so over-repeatedly referred to as “the digital age”, too many
              daily routines for someone in the city are taken well care of by personal digital devices and
              softwares. The street scenes in China, for instance, are absolutely bombarded with QR codes, which
              have become this omnipotent tunnel that links to virtually everything. From buying fruits in grocery
              stores to clarifying oneself as “Covid-free”, from ordering food in restaurants to reserving a
              museum ticket, QR code is the essence of modern life in China. This frightening craze for QR codes
              in China at any time will render anyone without a phone, or even without Wechat (the omnipresent
              social media / mobile payment / everything application created by the tech giant Tencent) as
              disabled, technically disabled. While many Chinese triumph over the convience and efficiency that
              the ubiquitous QR codes have enabled, the society’s heavy reliance on it is pushing people that have
              difficulty accessing mobile devices (the technically-illiterate and the financially-challenged in
              particular, but it could be anyone at some point really) into a extremely vulnerable and powerless
              position. </p>

            <p><em>Inspiration</em>. Both Ben Shpigel’s essay and Stella Young’s TED talk put this word onto the central
              stage of debate. <em>Inspiration</em>, this seemingly uplifting word, has brought frustration to people
              who are considered as “disabled”. And, it’s never been the word’s fault, it sure is to be used to convey
              an encouraging and positive attitude. The problem surfaces however when the word <em>inspiration</em> is
              used when “normal” people try to fabricate a narrative around the “disabled” people to encourage another
              group of “normal” people. The majority in the society, the “normal”, is the sender and the recipient, the
              manufacturer and the consumer — the absolute center of this celebration carnival. Yet the “disabled” is
              put into the position of the consumable and the prey. This sickening narrative “[objectifies] one group of
              people for the benefit of another group of people”, said by Young. “Disabled” people have the chance to
              make their appearances in the public view nowadays largely because the dominant majority sees the
              potential in them as “objects of inspiration” that can in turn better serve the the majority of this
              society which actually disable the “disabled” and put them into difficult positions more than anything
              else. “Disabled” people are fundamentally othered according to an ever-present definition of
              <em>normalcy</em> and every bits of their virtues, achievements and humanity are thus evaluated
              differently which to a certain degree leads to the dehumanization of the “disabled” people.
            </p>
            <p>So the next question is, who’s to define <em>normalcy</em>? I intentionally put quotation marks on the
              word “disabled” and the word “normal” every time they appear in the paragraph above for I believe that
              there is an urge to reflect on and re-evaluate our preconception of these two notions and to question the
              nature of <em>normalcy</em>. Asides from people who are more commonly classified as having disabilities,
              the elderly, shortsighted people, mid-aged employees who suffer from depression and anxiety, young kids,
              people who have lactose intolerance, just to name a few, may all run into all sort of difficult
              situations. And what’s most important, many many of the difficult situations and discriminations towards
              these people are fundamentally encouraged and bred by this society of low tolerance and ignorance. </p>
            <p>In fact, most standards we tend to set as the <em>normalcy</em> across different fields are
              non-representative, to put it nicely, or faulty, to put it more accurately. A presumption that a person
              should have one head, two arms, two legs, should be able to do five push-ups, enjoy peanut butter, operate
              a smartphone and so on has made us narrow-minded. Apart from blunt discriminations, physical or verbal,
              towards people who fail to meet the society’s standard for <em>normalcy</em>, a broader and seemingly
              invisible discrimination emerges on a cultural level, and manifests itself most profoundly in field of
              industrial design, according to Sara Hendren. The modern industrial design, despite those “inspirational”
              promises that advanced technologies and design theories have given to us, has greatly failed in being
              aware of the different and personalized needs from different people in different physical and mental
              conditions and in turn accommodate for each. Most of the so-called “human factors design” data put into
              the ergonomic design are almost solely based on healthy, young, white males. This monopolized kind of
              human condition and aesthetics might even recall Walter Benjamin’s theory of “the aestheticization of
              politics” which in Benjamin’s words was the key ingredient to the fascist regimes. In order to combat this
              dangerous intolerance, the next step should be for us to advocate for an open mind that can accept
              different people as being different, and to be more democratic and inclusive in the designing and
              decision-making process.</p>
