            <p>One big takeaway from both the virtual field
              trip to ADA and the videos on Lynn Valley’s website is in fact surprisingly the promise of
              “Do-It-Yourself” which is coming back in fashion. As we feel feeble when looking at the jaw-dropping
              prices of adaptive devices commonly found on the market and facing designers’ monopolized
              taste-making, the concept of DIY can be a remedy to reclaim the control of personal life. Cardboard,
              the magic medium that ADA has long trusted and put into wide use, is without exaggeration the single
              best medium for DIY adaptive design. Hours before the second week’s class have I forgotten to
              prepare some cardboard for the class only to realize they are readily spotted lying at the corners
              of my home – packing boxes that come with deliveries on a daily basis. One may never be worried
              about running out of cardboard but to compliment on its rigidity and versatility. </p>
            <p>As a person’s need can be so infinitely specifc
              and idiosyncratic, the person herself/himself or close family members can turn out to be the most
              appropriate designer candidate. With mass production, project launch and bureaucracy out of the way,
              and with any material at hand (cardboard obviously as a nice choice), one can make designs that
              adapt to personal needs just fine. In that, to me the biggest contribution of ADA and Valley’s
              website is their educational values. The videos of simple yet sufficient designs introduced by Lynn
              Valley, workshops held in ADA, and the vitual field trip to ADA as it is, are precious inspirations
              that advocate for mutual help and self-help within our respective communities.</p>
            <p>The chapter “Feeling Meets Testing” in the book
              <em>Design Meets Disability</em> converses mainly around the concept of <em>experience
                prototyping.</em> A rather recently-recognized concept that centers around user experience in its
              development at the potential expense of other criteria within a larger project. Well responding to
              the aim of eliminating ambiguity in defining the term <em>prototype</em> and clarifying the roles of
              various types of prototypes in their respective fields, the essay suggests that in certain
              appropriate cases, the user experience and client’s direct (or almost direct) engagement in the
              ongoing project can be and should be foremost prioritized even if it requires faking certain
              mechanism or technology and making temporary compromises on other aspects of the design as long as
              the promise at the end could be realized.
            </p>
            <p>The emphasis on experience prototyping in modern
              design, particularly in adaptive design lies in the fact that user experience has become indeed the
              dominant factor in determining the value of a piece of design and ties with the design’s fundamental
              purpose. Feedbacks retrieved from experience prototypes could potentially avoid waste of huge
              financial investment and numerous person-hours, and guide designers toward some more promising
              direction as early as possible. </p>
            <p>Another important and compelling role of
              experience prototyping is to figure out “what is the question” aside from to figure out “what is the
              answer”. As illustrated in the second half of the chapter with a series of user cases, experience
              prototyping’s capability of stimulating introspections, or public discussions around social issues
              challenges against the idea of <em>design</em> being merely a tool for problem-solving and reveals
              its potential of pushing humanity forward.</p>
            <p>The chapter “Identity Meets Ability” in the same
              book questions the existence of a clear distinction between “disabled” and “able-bodied”, adaptive
              design and mainstream design, and faults the binary philosophy underneath such definitions. “Every
              human being can experience some degree of disability.” This idea put forward by WHO may well be a
              guideline for designing for a wider audience, or to say, <em>universal design. </em>The chapter
              elaborates this idea even further as something that would sound like “every human being can
              experience some degree of disability depending on the context they are situated in.” It is the
              society and life situations that define one’s disability and ability. So commonly and easily have we
              connect the word “disabled” with the idea of physical impairment but in fact “activity limitation”
              and “participation restriction” as two manifestations of disability, which, yes, “impairment” may
              well lead to, in a broader view, can be seen as “a universal human experience”. On an imaginary
              spectrum of disability, almost everyone can find a position in any of its multiple dimensions. Take
              “visual impaired” as a example – people who are physically blind, people who are shortsighted,
              people who are shortsighted and accidentally forget to wear glasses, people whose eyes are occupied,
              people who don’t feel like having their eyes occupied, and many many other, can at some point be
              “visually impaired” and demand for adaptive designs that cater to this difficulty. </p>
            <p>Disability may even extend beyond the realm of
              the human body. In this world that is so over-repeatedly referred to as “the digital age”, too many
              daily routines for someone in the city are taken well care of by personal digital devices and
              softwares. The street scenes in China, for instance, are absolutely bombarded with QR codes, which
              have become this omnipotent tunnel that links to virtually everything. From buying fruits in grocery
              stores to clarifying oneself as “Covid-free”, from ordering food in restaurants to reserving a
              museum ticket, QR code is the essence of modern life in China. This frightening craze for QR codes
              in China at any time will render anyone without a phone, or even without Wechat (the omnipresent
              social media / mobile payment / everything application created by the tech giant Tencent) as
              disabled, technically disabled. While many Chinese triumph over the convience and efficiency that
              the ubiquitous QR codes have enabled, the society’s heavy reliance on it is pushing people that have
              difficulty accessing mobile devices (the technically-illiterate and the financially-challenged in
              particular, but it could be anyone at some point really) into a extremely vulnerable and powerless
              position. </p>

    <p><em>Inspiration</em>. Both Ben Shpigel’s essay and Stella Young’s TED talk put this word onto the central
      stage of debate. <em>Inspiration</em>, this seemingly uplifting word, has brought frustration to people
      who are considered as “disabled”. And, it’s never been the word’s fault, it sure is to be used to convey
      an encouraging and positive attitude. The problem surfaces however when the word <em>inspiration</em> is
      used when “normal” people try to fabricate a narrative around the “disabled” people to encourage another
      group of “normal” people. The majority in the society, the “normal”, is the sender and the recipient, the
      manufacturer and the consumer — the absolute center of this celebration carnival. Yet the “disabled” is
      put into the position of the consumable and the prey. This sickening narrative “[objectifies] one group of
      people for the benefit of another group of people”, said by Young. “Disabled” people have the chance to
      make their appearances in the public view nowadays largely because the dominant majority sees the
      potential in them as “objects of inspiration” that can in turn better serve the the majority of this
      society which actually disable the “disabled” and put them into difficult positions more than anything
      else. “Disabled” people are fundamentally othered according to an ever-present definition of
      <em>normalcy</em> and every bits of their virtues, achievements and humanity are thus evaluated
      differently which to a certain degree leads to the dehumanization of the “disabled” people.
    </p>
    <p>So the next question is, who’s to define <em>normalcy</em>? I intentionally put quotation marks on the
      word “disabled” and the word “normal” every time they appear in the paragraph above for I believe that
      there is an urge to reflect on and re-evaluate our preconception of these two notions and to question the
      nature of <em>normalcy</em>. Asides from people who are more commonly classified as having disabilities,
      the elderly, shortsighted people, mid-aged employees who suffer from depression and anxiety, young kids,
      people who have lactose intolerance, just to name a few, may all run into all sort of difficult
      situations. And what’s most important, many many of the difficult situations and discriminations towards
      these people are fundamentally encouraged and bred by this society of low tolerance and ignorance. </p>
    <p>In fact, most standards we tend to set as the <em>normalcy</em> across different fields are
      non-representative, to put it nicely, or faulty, to put it more accurately. A presumption that a person
      should have one head, two arms, two legs, should be able to do five push-ups, enjoy peanut butter, operate
      a smartphone and so on has made us narrow-minded. Apart from blunt discriminations, physical or verbal,
      towards people who fail to meet the society’s standard for <em>normalcy</em>, a broader and seemingly
      invisible discrimination emerges on a cultural level, and manifests itself most profoundly in field of
      industrial design, according to Sara Hendren. The modern industrial design, despite those “inspirational”
      promises that advanced technologies and design theories have given to us, has greatly failed in being
      aware of the different and personalized needs from different people in different physical and mental
      conditions and in turn accommodate for each. Most of the so-called “human factors design” data put into
      the ergonomic design are almost solely based on healthy, young, white males. This monopolized kind of
      human condition and aesthetics might even recall Walter Benjamin’s theory of “the aestheticization of
      politics” which in Benjamin’s words was the key ingredient to the fascist regimes. In order to combat this
      dangerous intolerance, the next step should be for us to advocate for an open mind that can accept
      different people as being different, and to be more democratic and inclusive in the designing and
      decision-making process.</p>
