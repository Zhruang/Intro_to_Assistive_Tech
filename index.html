          <p class="openingParagraph">Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it actually says nothing,” <i>Before & After</i> magazine answered a curious reader, “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.”</p>
            <p>As Cicero would put it, “Um, not so fast.”</p>
            <p>The placeholder text, beginning with the line “<i>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit</i>”, looks like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.</p>
            <p>Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of <i>lorem ipsum</i>, his interest was piqued by <i>consectetur</i>—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from <i>De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</i> (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.</p>
            <p>In particular, the garbled words of <i>lorem ipsum</i> bear an unmistakable resemblance to sections 1.10.32–33 of Cicero's work, with the most notable passage excerpted below:</p>
            <p><i>“Neque porro quisquam est, qui <strong>dolorem ipsum</strong> quia <strong>dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed</strong> quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.”</i></p>
